# Scenario: we're shopping for a pair of shoes. The store has a list of shoe
# sizes in random order, but we only want to find the first shoe size that
# fits or is larger than our foot size. The store clerk doesnâ€™t organise the
# shoe sizes, so we must check each size sequentially.

# Task:
# Write a program using linear search to find the shoe size that
# is equal to your foot size. If no exact shoe size fits your foot size,
# suggest whether closest sizes are available, and if none,
# return "Shoe size not in stock."

# Approach: will make use of linear search as the data is unsorted, small,
# and can be easier to understand (readability).
