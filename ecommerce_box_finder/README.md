**Problem:** we work for an e-commerce company that ships products in boxes of
different sizes. The available box sizes (in cubic inches) are stored in
a sorted list, and we need to pick the smallest box that can fit a given
product's volume.

Binary search is the most efficient algorithm for solving this particular
problem, assuming the following conditions are met:

## Key Assumptions:

    Sorted Input Array: The list of box sizes (box_sizes) is sorted in ascending order.
    
    Random Access: The array allows constant-time access to any element (as in Python lists).

Under these conditions, binary search offers the best time complexity, **O(log⁡n)**, for finding the smallest valid box.

## Why Binary Search is Optimal:

    Time Complexity:
        Binary search operates by repeatedly halving the search range. It requires at most log⁡_2(n) comparisons to find the target or conclude that no valid box exists.
        No other algorithm can guarantee better than O(log⁡n) for this problem, assuming the input is sorted.

    Targeted Search:
        Binary search narrows the search range intelligently, only examining elements that could possibly meet the condition (box_sizes[mid] >= product1_volume).
        Alternatives like linear search would require O(n) time, which is significantly slower for large datasets.
